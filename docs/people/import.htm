<doc for="api">
  Allows you to post an array of people to be imported, returns the identifiers
  assigned to every one of them. 

  This is the recommended way of adding multiple people to the database.

  # Request

  Each imported profile may contain the following fields: 

</doc> 
<fields for="api">
  email | <label>       | The only mandatory field, should contain a valid e-mail 
                          address for the person.
  name  | <label>, null | Optional, but recommended nonetheless, as it will be 
                          used as the display name of the person (that is, it will
                          become field `label` of the [<short>](/people/short.htm) 
	                  values returned by the API). 
  givenName  | <label>, null  | A given name, optional.
  familyName | <label>, null  | A family name, optional.
  gender     | "M", "F", null | The person's gender, optional.
</fields>
<doc for="api">

  You may skip the `givenName` and `familyName` fields safely. This will be the
  case for people in a culture that does not have such naming conventions, or simply 
  because the data is unavailable (it may be provided later).

  There is no limit on the number of people to be provided, though the request
  may bounce due to the [global limit on request body sizes](/config/httpd.htm). 

  # Response

  When successful, `202 Accepted`: this is a [delayed](/concepts/delayed.htm),
  [sync-idempotent](/doncepts/sync-idempotent.md) request.

  The response contains two fields: 

</doc>
<fields for="api">
  at | <clock> | The [clock position](/concepts/delayed.htm) when all the 
                 imported people will be available.
  imported | <id> array | The identifiers associated to the imported people, 
                          in the same order as the array of people in the request.
</fields>

  # Duplicate entries
 
  Duplicate entries (that is, entries for which a person already exists with
  the same email address) will be silently ignored, and the identifier for the 
  old person will be returned. 

  Please note that the `email` field is not a strict uniqueness constraint: 
  there are normal situations under which two or more people may share an
  email address. The import procedure will avoid creating such duplicates for 
  your convenience, but does not guarantee uniqueness. In particular, if two 
  imports run in parallel with duplicate data, then duplicate email addresses 
  may appear.

  # Errors

  If you sent this request but did not receive a response (network timeouts, 
   internal server errors...), use the fact that it is 
  [sync-idempotent](/concepts/sync-idempotent.htm).

  ## Returns `401 Unauthorized`
  - if the provided token does not allow importing new people, or no token was provided

  ## Returns `403 Forbidden`
  - if person `{as}` is not allowed to import people.

  ## Returns `404 Not Found`
  - if database `{db}` does not exist

  # Access restrictions
  
  Only [database administrators](/groups/admin.htm) may list all people
  in the database.
