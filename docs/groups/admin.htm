  The group with identifier `"admin"` is a special group: 

  - It is created at the same time as the database ;
  - It cannot be [deleted](/docs/#/group/delete.js) ;
  - It is used internally for most access granting.
  
  A member of group `admin` can perform any operation on the database,
  regardless of the access restrictions for that operation.
