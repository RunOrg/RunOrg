  provide data relevant for displaying the group: its label and count.

<fields>
  id     | <id>           | The identifier of the group in the database.

                            to the viewer.

	                    This field is only available if the viewer has **list** 
	                    access to the group.
  audience | <audience>, null | The current audience of the group. See [audience and 
	                        access](/concepts/audience.htm) for more information.
	                        This field is only available if the viewer has **admin**
