  # Administrating the form: `"admin"`

  The **admin** access allows any operations that can be performed on 
  the form.

  It includes **fill** access.

  # Filling the form: `"fill"` 

  The **fill** access allows:

  - Reading a form's meta-data (but not all fields)
  - Filling the form. Which instances can be filled depends on the
    ownership of those instances. For `"contact"` ownership, for example,
    a contact may only fill his own instance. 
  - Viewing any filled form instance they can re-fill.
