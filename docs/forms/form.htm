  Returned by several API methods that involve forms. In addition to a
  label and custom JSON, it determines the behaviour of a form: what the fields
  are and who is allowed to fill it.

  A form may be filled several times, each is called a **filled form
  instance** and is bound to an owner. 
  
  This object is [viewer-dependent](/concepts/viewer-dependent.htm): its 
  contents depend on the identity of the viewer.

<fields>
  id | <id> | The identifier of the form.
  owner | "person" | The nature of the owner associated with each filled
                     instance of the form. In the current version of the API, 
                     this is always `"person"` (each instance is owned by a person).
  label | <label>, null | An optional human-readable label.
  fields | <field> array | An ordered list of [fields](/forms/field.htm) to be
	                   filled.
  custom | <json> | An arbitrary block of JSON provided by the creator of the
	            form, and returned as-is by the API.
  access | <access> array | The list of access levels the viewer has over the
	                    form. See [audience and access](/concepts/audience.htm)
	                    for more information. 
  audience | <audience> | Only available to viewers with access level **admin**.
	                  The [audience](/forms/audience.htm) of the form.
