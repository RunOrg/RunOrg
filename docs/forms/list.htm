  `RunOrg.Form.List(limit, offset)` reads `limit` groups from the 
  database, starting at `offset`. The order is unspecified but 
  consistent. 

  Only groups for which the viewer has **view** access will be included
  in the list.

  Returns a [promise](/concepts/promise.htm) that will resolve to a 
  list of filled [`RunOrg.Form`](/forms/form.htm) instances, with two 
  major differences: 

  - Members `custom` and `audience` are not returned.
  - Member `fields` is replaced by the number of fields.

  RunOrg.Form.List(10, 0).then(function(list) {
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; ++i) 
      console.log("Form %s has %d fields", list[i].id, list[i].fields)    
  })
