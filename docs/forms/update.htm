  If `form` is an instance of [`RunOrg.Form`](/forms/form.htm), 
  then `form.Save()` uploads its non-`id` fields to the server.

  Returns a [promise](/concepts/promise.htm) that will resolve to the
  `form` object.

  # Errors

  ## Returns `401 Unauthorized` 
  - if the provided token does not allow acting as `{as}`.

  ## Returns `403 Forbidden`
  - if the requester does not have **admin** access to the form.

  ## Returns `404 Not Found`
  - if the database does not exist,
  - if form `{id}` does not exist in the database,
  - if person `{as}` does not have at least **fill** access
    to form `{id}`, to ensure [absence 
    equivalence](/concepts/absence-equivalence.md).

  # Access restrictions

  An [access level](/forms/audience.htm) of **admin** is required 
  to update form information.
