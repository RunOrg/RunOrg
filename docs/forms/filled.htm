  A javascript representation of a filled instance of a [form](/forms/form.htm).
  
  This object is [viewer-dependent](/concepts/viewer-dependent.htm): its 
  contents depend on the identity of the viewer.

  Use [RunOrg.Form.Fill(owner)](/forms/jsfill.htm) to create a `RunOrg.Form.Filled`
  javascript object, which can then be used to read or write the filled
  form instance.
