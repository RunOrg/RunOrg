Chatrooms

A **chatroom** is a list of participants and a list of items shared
between them.

The **participants** are listed as either [groups](/docs/#/group.md)
or individual [contacts](/docs/#/contact.md).

Chatroom messages are called **items**, and are not necessarily pieces
of text (arbitrary content is allowed, with the client being
responsible for rendering any custom formats).
