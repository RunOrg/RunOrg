People

A human **person**, a type of entity used throughout the RunOrg API 
for many purposes, the most important being:  

 - Message and email recipients are always people. All sending APIs
   expect either individuals or [groups](/docs/#/group.md) of people 
   as their parameters.
 - Everyone who logs in, using any method, is bound to a person. 
 - Access restrictions are based on the [person who performs the
   action](/docs/#/concept/as.md).
