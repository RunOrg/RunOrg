People

A **person**, organization or other named entity. Person objects are
used throughout the RunOrg API for many purposes, the most important
using are:  

 - Message and email recipients are always people. All sending APIs
   expect either individual contacts or groups of people as their 
   parameters.
 - Everyone who logs in, using any method, is bound to a person. 
 - Access restrictions are based on which [groups](/docs/#/group.md) a 
   person belongs to.
