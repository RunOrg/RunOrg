(** Links and link roots. A typical link identifier is 27 
    characters long. With a 10-character domain, the full 
    size of a link URL is 66 characters. Not excellent, but
    at least it fits on one line in text mode.

(** Link roots are common prefixes of the link token that
    can be used to identify (uniquely!) an (mid,cid) pair.
    They are also random enough to be tampering-proof, by
    incorporating a [Token] inside. *)
