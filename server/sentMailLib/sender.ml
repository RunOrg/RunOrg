(* This module works under the assumption that only one instance of the sending 
   process may run at any given time. In a single-application context, this is
   guaranteed by the semantics of [Run.service].

   In a multi-application context... better get some cross-process mutex going, son.

   This module is the only one that pushes [`Sent] or [`SendingFailed] events to
   the stream. This means that, as long as the service is careful to synchronize
   with its own previous work, there will be no accidental double-sending.

(* This function returns a batch of scheduled mail, if any. It synchronizes with

   selecting scheduled mail. 

   In other words: scheduled mail returned by this function has NOT been sent yet.
