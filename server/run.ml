type thr = 
  | Fork of thr list Lazy.t 
  | Wait of thr Event.event
  | Raise of exn 
  | Yield of thr 

(* A thread is evaluated using: 
   - a context 
   - a successful return function (called on the result) 
   - a failed return function (called on the exception)

   The thread may call one of the two return functions directly, 
   and may return zero, one or more new threads to be added to the
   evaluation queue.    

   Such a function (usually either m or mFoo below) never raises
   exceptions, nor does the lazy evaluation of the returned [thr]  
   raise an exception. 

   Also, while the failed return function never
   raises exceptions either, the successful return function may 
   raise exceptions, and so should be defended against.
