(** An audience is a set of contacts, represented as a union of groups and a (short)
    list of individual contacts. It can also be represented as "anyone". 

    The JSON representation is either the string ["anyone"], or an object with 
    fields [{"groups":[...],"contacts":[...]}] where both fields are optional
    and assumed to be empty if missing.

    This is used for membership purposes, as opposed to authorization.
