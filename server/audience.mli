(** An audience is a set of contacts, represented as a union of groups and a (short)
    list of individual contacts. It can also be represented as "anyone". 

    The JSON representation is either the string ["anyone"], or an object with 
    fields [{"groups":[...],"contacts":[...]}] where both fields are optional
    and assumed to be empty if missing.

(** Returns true if a specified contact is member of the provided audience. 
    This is used for membership purposes, as opposed to authorization. 

    Note that storing [is_member id] and using it multiple times will avoid
    extraneous queries to the database.
