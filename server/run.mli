(** Lightweight cooperative threads, with context. *)

(** A lightweight thread that computes a value of type ['value] in a context
    of type ['ctx']. This is semantically similar to ['ctx -> 'value], except
    that the computation of [('ctx,'value) t] may be broken down into smaller
    substeps to allow concurrency.

    A thread may be executed more than once: it will perform the same
    operation again. 
*)
type ( -'ctx, +'value ) t

(** A lightweight thread that performs a side-effect, then returns. 
    Use this type, rather than ['ctx thread], to indicate your intent of 
    having a short-lived operation. *)
type 'ctx effect = ('ctx,unit) t

(** A lightweight thread that runs forever, performing side-effects. 
    Use this type, rather than ['ctx effect], to indicate your intent of
    having a long-lived operation. *)
type 'ctx thread = 'ctx effect

(** {2 Monad usage} *)

(** Wraps an already-computed value in a lightweight thread. 

    {[
    let! value = return 12 in
    assert(value = 12)
    ]}

    Likely to be the most used function in this module. 
*)
val return  : 'value -> ('ctx,'value) t 

(** Start a new thread from the result of another. 

    In practice, use [let!] rather than [bind] for clarity: by definition, 
    [let! a = b in c] is equivalent to [bind (fun a -> b) c]. 
*)
val bind    : ('a -> ('ctx,'b) t) -> ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'b) t

(** Apply a function to the result of a thread. 

    [map f t] is equivalent to [bind (f |- return) t]
*)
val map     : ('a -> 'b) -> ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'b) t

(** A thread-that-returns-a-thread-that-returns-X can be seen as
    a thread-that-returns-X. *)
val unwrap  : ('ctx,('ctx,'a) t) t -> ('ctx,'a) t

(** {2 Context manipulation} *)

(** A thread that returns the context it was executed in. Typical usage: 

    {[ let! ctx = context in ]}
*)
val context : ('ctx,'ctx) t

(** Run a thread in the specified context. This returns a thread
    which can be executed in any context (since that context will 
    be replaced with the specified context). 

    {[ 
with_context 10 (
  let! ctx = context in 
  assert(ctx = 10))
    ]}
*)
val with_context : 'ctx -> ('ctx,'a) t -> ('any,'a) t 

(** A helper function for using {!context} and {!with_context} in
    succession. 

    {[
with_context 10 (
  edit_context ((+) 5) (
    let! ctx = context in 
    assert(ctx = 15)))
*)
val edit_context : ('ca -> 'cb) -> ('cb,'any) t -> ('ca,'any) t

(** {2 Evaluation} *)

(** Evaluates a thread in a context. Runs until all threads 
    spawned by the original thread have completed.

    If an exception is raised by a thread, all threads immediately 
    stop and the exception escapes [eval]. Note that forked threads
    may fail without causing the evaluation to fail.

    {[ assert( 10 = eval 5 (let! n = context in return (n * 2)) ) ]}
*)
val eval : 'ctx -> ('ctx,'a) t -> 'a 

(** Start several long-running operations in parallel. 

    If an exception is raised by a thread, and [exn_handler] returns 
    true, then that thread is killed and all threads which were 
    dependent on it are aborted, then the root thread is restarted. 
    
    If [exn_handler] returns false, the exception bubbles up. 
    By default, [exn_handler] always returns true. 

    For instance, after calling [start ctx [a;b]], if the evaluation 
    of thread [a] (or one of the sub-threads on which it is dependent)
    causes an exception, then [a] will be re-started from scratch. 
*)
val start : ?exn_handler:(exn -> bool) -> 'ctx -> 'ctx thread list -> unit

(** {2 Concurrency manipulation} *)

(** [yield t] gives {b all} other threads on the system a chance to run, then 
    returns. *)
val yield  : ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'a) t 

(** [join a b f] will run [a] and [b] in parallel, yielding results [a'] and [b'], 
    then return [f a' b']. *)
val join   : ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'b) t -> ('a -> 'b -> ('ctx,'c) t) ->  ('ctx,'c) t

(** [fork x a] will run [x] at some point in the future, and returns [a]. *)
val fork   : (exn -> 'ctx effect) -> 'ctx effect -> ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'a) t 

(** A thread joiner is used to wait for an arbitrary number of threads to finish. 

    The code below waits until both [frobnicate 1] and [frobnicate 2] have 
    finished running, then returns. 

    {[
    let frobincate : int -> 'ctx effect = (* Some long-running operation *) in
    let joiner = new joiner in
    fork (joiner # start (frobnicate 1))
      (fork (joiner # start (frobnicate 2))
        (joiner # wait))    
    ]}
*)
class ['ctx] joiner : object

  (** Waits until all threads started with [start] have finished, then returns. *)
  method wait : ('ctx, unit) t

  (** The passed thread will block [wait] until it is finished. *)
  method start : ('ctx, unit) t -> ('ctx, unit) t 

end 

(** A mutually exclusive lock. *)
class mutex : object

  (** Blocks until the mutex is unlocked, then locks the mutex, executes
      the thread, and unlocks the mutex when it is finished. 
    
      The locking thread should {b never} lock the mutex again: doing so 
      will cause a deadlock. *)
  method lock : ('ctx, 'a) t -> ('ctx, 'a) t 

  (** If the mutex is currently unlocked, runs the thread without locking.
      If the mutex is locked, performs exactly as [lock]. *)
  method if_unlocked : ('ctx, 'a) t -> ('ctx, 'a) t 

  (** Returns false if this mutex is not currently locked, and will remain
      unlocked until the end of the current synchronous operation (the next
      time it will yield control to the scheduler). *)
  method locked : bool

end

(** A counting semaphore.*)
class ['ctx] semaphore : object

  (** The number of gives minus the number of takes *)
  method count : int 

  (** If there are threads waiting on the semaphore, unlocks the oldest one 
      and runs it. The argument is the number of [give]s to be given
      (that is, the number of threads to be unlocked). *)
  method give : int -> ('ctx, unit) t 

  (** If [give] was called more than [take], executes the passed thread. 
      Otherwise, the passed thread is blocked until [give] is called. *)
  method take : ('ctx, unit) t 

end 

(** Call a function in a background thread, return a task that waits
    for the result of that function. *)

val background : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> ('ctx, 'b) t 

(** {2 Services} *)

(** A service is a long-running background thread. Unlike an actual thread, 
    it does not run forever: it terminates as soon as it runs out of work 
    to do. When new work becomes available, the thread that created the 
    work can [ping] the service: if it is already running, nothing happens. 
    Otherwise, the initiator thread is forked and the fork runs the 
    service. *)
type service

(** Pings the service: if it is not already running, forks the thread and
    starts running it. 

    If it is already running, it will run the service once again after it
    finishes. While a bit wasteful, this approach avoids all concurrency
    issues by starting the service at least once after each call to [ping]. *)
val ping : service -> 'ctx effect

(** Create a new service from a work function that returns when there is no 
    more work to do. Also includes the name of the service, used for logging
    exceptions that occur while running the effect. *) 
val service : string -> unit effect -> service

(** {2 Utilities} *)

(** If [memo t] is executed several times in the same context, then it may 
    cache the result of [t] instead of evaluating [t] every single time. 
    There is, however, no guarantee about the specific number of times 
    [t] may be called (except that it will be called at least once in each
    different context).
*)
val memo : ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'a) t

(** [of_call f a] is equivalent to [bind f (return a)] *) 
val of_call  : ('a -> ('ctx,'b) t) -> 'a -> ('ctx,'b) t

(** [of_func f] is equivalent to [of_call (map f) ()] *)
val of_func  : (unit -> 'value) -> ('ctx,'value) t

(** [of_lazy l] forces [l] every time it is evaluated. *)
val of_lazy  :    'value Lazy.t -> ('ctx,'value) t

(** [of_channel c] attempts to read a value from channel [c] every time it
    is evaluated. *)
val of_channel : 'value Event.channel -> ('ctx,'value) t

(** [on_failure f m] attempts to run [m], and calls [f exn] if an exception
    occurred while running [m]. *)
val on_failure : (exn -> ('ctx,'a) t) -> ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'a) t

(** [finally f m] calls [f ()] when [m] has finished running (whether 
    successfully or because of an exception). Any threads forked during
    the execution of [m] may still be running. *)
val finally : (unit -> unit) -> ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'a) t

(** [loop (fun continue -> ...)] runs its body and returns the
    result. The body may return [continue] to have the loop 
    run its body again. 

    {[
    let n = ref 10 in
    loop (fun continue ->
      if !n = 0 then return () else (decr n ; continue))
    ]}

    Note that [continue] internally uses [yield]: every other thread
    will get a chance to run in-between iterations of the loop.
*)
val loop : ( ('ctx,'a) t -> ('ctx,'a) t ) -> ('ctx, 'a) t

(** List operations. These are also available as part of {!Std.List.M}. 
    
    Unless otherwise noted, they are the equivalent of their [List] module 
    counterparts, but with the functions returning threads instead of 
    values. 

    Unless otherwise noted, they are {b not} sequential. For example, 
    [ForList.map f [a;b]] may excute [f a] before or after (or during) 
    the evaluation of [f b]. 
*)
module ForList : sig
    
  val map        : ( 'it -> ('ctx,'value) t ) -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'value list) t 
  val filter_map : ( 'it -> ('ctx,'value option) t ) -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'value list) t
  val filter     : ( 'it -> ('ctx,bool) t ) -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'it list) t
  val iter       : ( 'it -> 'ctx effect ) -> 'it list -> 'ctx effect

  (** Sequential *)
  val iter_seq   : ( 'it -> 'ctx effect ) -> 'it list -> 'ctx effect 

  (** Sequential by definition. *)
  val fold_left  : ( 'acc -> 'it -> ('ctx,'acc) t ) -> 'acc -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'acc) t 

  (** Sequential: [find f l] only calls [f] on elements before the one that returned [true]. *)
  val exists     : ( 'it -> ('ctx, bool) t ) -> 'it list -> ('ctx,bool) t

  (** Sequential: [find f l] only calls [f] on elements before the returned element. *)
  val find       : ( 'it -> ('ctx,'value option) t ) -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'value option) t

  (** [collect f l] is equivalent to [Run.map List.flatten (map f l)]. *) 
  val collect    : ( 'it -> ('ctx,'value list) t ) -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'value list) t

  (** [mfold f acc l] is equivalent to [bind (fold_left (fun a f -> f a) acc) (map f l)]. This 
      means the [map] part is parallel and the [fold] part is sequential. *)
  val mfold      : ( 'it -> ('ctx,'acc -> ('ctx,'acc) t) t) -> 'acc -> 'it list -> ('ctx,'acc) t

end

(** Option operations. These are also available as part of {!Std.Option.M} 

    They are the equivalent of their [Option] module counterparts. *)

module ForOption : sig

  val map       : ( 'a  -> ('ctx,'b) t ) -> 'a option -> ('ctx,'b option) t 
  val bind      : ( 'a  -> ('ctx,'b option) t ) -> 'a option -> ('ctx,'b option) t
