(* We cannot use the standard generation function here, because its output is 
   predictable. Instead, we generate an HMAC of a standard identifier, using the
   configured token key. This HMAC is converted to base62 and truncated. 
   
   For 1 000 000 simultaneous sessions, there is a 3e-6 probability of collision
   (because the 11-character base62 identifier is generated from a random 
   64-bit value, with a single base62 character dropped). *)
