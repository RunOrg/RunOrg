(** The type of raw results. *)
type raw_result = string array array

(** Runs a query asynchronously. Queries are sequential (that is, 
    they are executed in the order they are provided in), but the
    asynchronous interface lets the program perform other operations
    while queries are running. *)

(** A command is like a query, but returns no results, and will
    block if a transaction is active (until the transaction ends). *)

(** Like [safe_command] but does not block when part of a transaction. *)

(** Runs a specific query on the first connection. *)

(** Executes an operation inside a transaction *)
