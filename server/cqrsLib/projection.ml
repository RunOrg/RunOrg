(* Projection methods : public side
   ================================ *)

(* Projections are a NASTY piece of work. 
   
   They source events of different types from multiple streams, so 
   it is impossible to keep track of all the individual streams that
   are followed by a projection from within the projection itself 
   (except by dropping the event type, at which point it becomes
   impossible to de-duplicate streams). 

   Because of this, projections have to rely on streams to perform
   de-duplication themselves. Each stream will remember all 
   projections that are following it, and use a hash table to store
   event processors (registered ith Stream.track) for each view.

  (* These values are computed once all the views have been 
     registered (because they expect ALL the views to be 
     registered in order to compute the projection's hash
     and deduce the version number) *)

  (* Whenever a stream is tracked, it adds a generic sequence
     to this list. Reading an element from this sequence will 
     read an event from a sequence, run all event handlers,
     and return the clock of the event (for checkpointing). *)
