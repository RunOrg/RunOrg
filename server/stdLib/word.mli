(** Library for manipulating words from a text. *)


(** Splits a string into searchable words. 

    A searchable word is in lowercase (for characters for which this
    has a meaning).  Lowercasing of ASCII characters is performed by
    OCaml using the current locale.

    Accented characters are converted to their conventional
    non-accented equivalent, where applicable. For instance, [Ã©] will
    turn into [e].

    Word slicing occurs across non-letter characters: ["Hello,
    world!"]  is split into ["hello"] and ["world"].  Some non-letter
    characters are kept (apostrophes and hyphens) because they often
    end up in a search pattern. These are both cut ant non cut: ["I'm
    ever-so-happy about this"] is cut into ["i"], ["m"], ["i.m"], 
    ["ever"], ["so"], ["happy"], ["ever.so.happy"], ["about"], ["this"].

val index : string -> string list 

(** Splits a string into searchable words, to be used as a search term.

    The output format is compatible with [index], with a few exceptions: 
    the words are returned without cutting dots (so ["I'm"] would only
    generate ["i.m"] instead of ["i"], ["m"] and ["i.m"]), and the last
    word is returned separately (since it will be used for a prefix 
    search).
